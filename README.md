# Unsupervised-Learning-
Objective : Use k-means clustering for image segmentation and to identify dominantcolor in the image.

# Question:
   
   1) Open and display the image "dog.jpeg". Convert the image in to numpy array, so that it can be used
      furtherprocessing.
      [Hint: Use PIL module from python]
   
   2) Find out the dimensions of the image and convert it in  to a two-dimensionalarray.
   
   3) Use kmeans clustering with k set 3 and cluster themimage.
      [Hint: Refer to k-means module of scikitlearn]
      
   4) Predict the cluster label of every pixel in the image and plot it beck as animage.
   
   5) Find out the three-dominant color in theimage.
